# Fibonacci-Calc
A short script to calculate N Fibonacci numbers from base cases (For Discrete Math Class).

## Usage:
Change the four values (two pairs of base cases) and update the number of iterations.

## A note on the golden ratio
Approximations of the golden ratio (1.618) are calculated by dividing the {N+1}th Fibonacci number by the {N}th number. Kinda neat.
